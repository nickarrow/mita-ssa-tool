# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.1.1] - 2026-09-22

Follow-up to the 4.1.0 pilot deploy. 4.1.0 put the offline Excel workbook in the tool for the first
time, and watching the deployed site showed the links were somewhere nobody would look: all three
sat 80-92% of the way down their pages, and nothing on any first screen mentioned Excel. That is the
wrong outcome for the one audience the workbook exists for — states that cannot use a browser-based
tool at all, who would have concluded the tool did not suit them and left before scrolling that far.

Its own version rather than an edit to 4.1.0, because 4.1.0 is already deployed and a state may
already be looking at it. Two builds sharing a version number is the traceability problem the 4.1.0
notes below complain about, and repeating it here would be careless.

### Changed

- **The workbook download is now offered on the home page, in the opening choice beside "Get
  Started"** rather than near the foot of the page. It stays a secondary option, since most states
  can use the browser tool. The duplicate link lower down the home page is gone
- Import & Export keeps its workbook section and gains a link at the top of the page pointing down to
  it, so it is findable without scrolling the export list. That link is now shareable too: opening
  the page at `#offline-workbook-section` scrolls to the section instead of landing at the top
- The home page heading, tagline and spacing now size to the screen, so the opening choice sits
  higher on a phone. It is still below the first screen there — the header, the two required notices
  and the footer leave a 287px content window at 375×667 — but roughly a sixth of the way down the
  page rather than four-fifths

## [4.1.0] - 2026-09-22

Pilot clearance release. Everything in it exists to get the tool and the offline workbook
through CMS internal clearance so the MITA 4.0 pilot can begin: the predecisional notices CMS
asked for, an accessibility pass against WCAG 2.1 AA, several scoring corrections, the offline
Excel workbook and its in-app download links, and a service worker that makes the long-standing
"works offline" claim true.

A MINOR release, and the two halves of that are worth separating. **No stored data format changed**
— the database schema is untouched, no migration runs, and existing assessments are unaffected.
**Export contents did change**, in four ways detailed under Changed and Fixed: the CSV maturity
profile gains a notice row, JSON and the ZIP manifest gain a `draftNotice` field, the PDF executive
summary gains an "Areas" column and its ORBIT Dimension Summary changes meaning, and **the exported
Technology figure changes value for identical stored data**. Anyone holding an export taken before
this release should re-export rather than compare the two.

One traceability note for anyone reconciling exports against versions: roughly half the Fixed
section — the Technology weighting, the To-Be figure, aggregate dimensions in PDFs, the N/A
labelling — went live on the pilot site on September 11, ahead of this release being numbered. So
exports produced since then are stamped `appVersion: 4.0.0` while already containing the corrected
figures.

Scope record and decision log: `docs/decisions/PILOT_CLEARANCE_PLAN.md`.

### Added

- **The offline Excel workbook can now be downloaded from inside the tool**, on Import & Export, the
  home page, and the Guide. It is a blank workbook covering the whole assessment for anyone who
  cannot use a browser-based tool, and each link is accompanied by what it is and roughly how large
  it is, so you know before you click. Previously the workbook existed but nothing in the app linked
  to it
- **The tool now genuinely works offline.** It always said it did, and it did not — there was no
  service worker, so a reload without a connection failed (OBS-22). Open it once with a
  connection and it now loads and runs with no network at all, including the offline Excel
  workbook, which is cached alongside the app. Your assessment data was always stored locally, so
  nothing about saving changes
- **You are told about new versions instead of being moved to one.** When an update is available a
  prompt offers to reload; until you accept, you keep working in the version you have. Deliberate,
  so an assessment in progress is never replaced by a new build mid-edit
- **A tab icon**, which was referenced but missing (OBS-28), plus the icon set needed to install
  the tool as an app on a desktop or phone
- Draft notice in every export format (PDF cover band and page footers, CSV, JSON, ZIP
  manifest), matching the in-app banner. Setting `VITE_DRAFT_MODE=false` removes it
  from the app and all exports in one build variable
- **Second disclaimer notice at the foot of every page**, carrying the Paperwork Reduction
  Act statement. CMS requires a notice at both the top and the bottom, with different
  wording in each
- **Offline Excel workbook, generated from the same data model as the tool.** A blank
  self-assessment workbook covering all 14 capability domains, 72 capability areas and 41
  maturity aspects, built for Section 508 conformance: no merged cells, one header row per
  table, no blank rows, no images, editable columns labelled "(enter value)" in text rather
  than signalled by fill colour alone, and reference cells locked but still selectable so
  assistive technology can read them. Editable cells are ruled on all four sides, because a
  solid fill covers Excel's gridlines and the input area would otherwise have no visible row
  or column boundaries. Excel's own Accessibility Checker reports no issues in any category.
  It is generated at build time by a Node script, so it adds nothing to the browser bundle
- **Score sheets in the workbook, calculating live as you type.** Four sheets of Excel
  formulas mirroring the tool's own scoring: a maturity profile with one row per capability
  area and dimension, per-area scores with completion percentages, domain scores with an
  overall figure, and an enterprise-wide ORBIT dimension summary. The formulas find your data
  by capability area and dimension rather than by row position, so the input sheets can be
  sorted and filtered freely. Aggregate dimensions, the Technology sub-dimension rule, the
  Enterprise Governance rollup and the treatment of N/A all follow the same rules as the
  online tool. Where Excel and the tool round a halfway value differently the workbook can
  differ by 0.1; the README explains which is authoritative and where it can occur
- **The workbook's arithmetic is verified by making Excel compute it**, not by inspecting
  formula text. `npm run verify:workbook-excel` opens a temp copy of the workbook in Excel,
  enters maturity levels and notes, reads the calculated cells back, and compares them against
  the tool's scoring rules — 41 checks across 9 scenarios. It found three defects that the test
  suite could not see, each of which would have put a wrong number in a state's submission:
  completion percentages above 100% on the 21 enterprise-domain capability areas, and
  capability areas that reported a score before anything had been entered for them, which
  inflated domain and overall figures. macOS with Excel only, so it is a manual gate rather
  than part of CI

### Changed

- **The PDF executive summary's "ORBIT Dimension Summary" is now the mean of per-area
  dimension scores, counting finalized assessments only.** It previously averaged every
  rating across all areas, so it was weighted by aspect count _and_ by how many areas
  had been assessed, and it silently included in-progress assessments while the domain
  table immediately above it counted finalized ones. A new "Areas" column shows the
  denominator
- **Disclaimer wording replaced with CMS-supplied text.** Both notices now open
  "Predecisional Pilot Materials:". The top notice states the materials are preliminary
  and being made available for limited review and testing in support of MITA 4.0 pilot
  activities; the bottom notice adds that they do not represent final agency policy or
  requirements and may not be used for an information collection subject to the PRA until
  applicable PRA requirements, including OMB approval where required, have been satisfied.
  Exports carry the full statement, since an artifact circulating without the PRA language
  is the specific risk the disclaimer covers. The wording is reproduced verbatim and the
  two bodies differ, so neither is derived from the other
- **Node 22.18 or newer is now required for development.** The workbook generator is a
  TypeScript file executed directly by Node, which needs Node's native type stripping. On an
  older Node the generator fails with an unknown-file-extension error, while `npm test` still
  passes because vitest transforms through Vite — so too-old Node fails in a confusing place.
  Declared in `engines` and `.nvmrc`; CI and deploy were moved from Node 20 to 22.18. Nothing
  about the shipped application changed

### Fixed

- **The offline claim on the home and guide pages was imprecise even once it became true.** Both
  said "full functionality after initial load," which did not tell you that the first visit needs
  a connection. They now say so
- **Security: the critical and high npm advisories in the shipped dependencies are resolved**
  (OBS-37). `jspdf` carried a critical advisory and `react-router` a high one, and both are in
  the code that runs in your browser. Fixed by `jspdf` 4.2.0 → 4.2.1, `react-router-dom`
  7.12.0 → 7.18.4 and `uuid` 11.1.0 → 11.1.1, which also picked up `dompurify` and `fflate`.
  Every one sat inside the version ranges the project already allowed, so no library changed
  in a way that alters behaviour. PDF export was re-checked against the upgraded `jspdf`, in
  the test suite and by generating a report in a browser: the Technology dimension score is
  still the corrected sub-dimension weighting from earlier in this release, not the old flat
  mean. **The dependencies that build and test the app were upgraded too**, clearing two
  further critical advisories. Two moderate advisories remain by choice, in a build-time-only
  library whose published "fix" is a downgrade that would break workbook generation; neither
  ships to your browser
- **Notes, Barriers and Advancement Plans on the workbook's maturity profile sheet showed
  `#NAME?`** instead of your text. Two causes: the function being used had to be written into
  the file with an internal prefix that was missing, and the function itself does not exist in
  Excel 2016 or earlier. Those three columns now use only functions available in Excel 2007, so
  they work in any version
- **The same three columns could show text belonging to a different capability area.** Behind
  the `#NAME?` was a second problem: the formula selected rows by matching capability area and
  dimension, and Excel evaluates that kind of comparison against only one row unless the
  formula is entered as an array. One capability area's cell could therefore contain another
  area's notes while the area that owned them showed nothing. The columns now read a fixed
  block of rows, which needs no array evaluation. Scores were never affected — they use
  `AVERAGEIFS`, which matches criteria correctly
- **The workbook README described sorting and filtering incorrectly.** Filtering the input
  sheets is supported and safe; scores are always calculated over the whole sheet, not just
  the visible rows. Rows must not be reordered, which sheet protection already prevents
- **The whole workbook now works in Excel 2007 and later**, with no add-ins, macros or internet
  connection. The build fails if a formula uses anything newer, so this holds rather than
  relying on review
- **Technology dimension score in PDF and CSV exports** (OBS-25). Both computed it as a
  flat mean over all 11 Technology aspects, which weights the 6-aspect Technical
  Infrastructure Management sub-dimension above the 5-aspect Application Management
  one. The rule is the mean of the two sub-dimension means. **A state's exported
  Technology figure can therefore change** — for example an area with Infrastructure
  all at 5 and Application all at 1 exported 3.2 and now correctly exports 3.0. This is
  a weighting correction, not rounding, so it does not diminish with more data. The CSV
  maturity profile is the artifact submitted to CMS, and it previously disagreed with
  the score the tool's own Results screen displayed for the same inputs
- **To-Be (target) Technology score**, same weighting error, in the CSV profile and on
  the Results screen. All scoring now delegates to the single canonical
  `calculateDimensionScore`
- **Aggregate dimensions were missing from PDF reports entirely** (OBS-3). A Data
  Management area's report showed Business Architecture and Technology but omitted
  Information, because the generator iterates actual ratings and aggregate dimensions
  have none by design. They now appear with their score and an
  `(Aggregate from N assessments)` note, matching the CSV and the Results screen
- **PDF labelled unassessed aspects as "N/A"** (OBS-2, fixed earlier in this branch,
  now covered by tests at the export boundary). Unassessed (`0`) reports as "Not Rated";
  only a genuine N/A determination (`-1`) reports as "N/A"
- `(Aggregate from 1 assessments)` now reads `(Aggregate from 1 assessment)`

## [4.0.0] - 2026-07-30

This major release aligns the tool with the revised MITA 4.0 Capability Reference Model presented by the BA working group (July 2026, slides 4–6 of the capability overview deck). The ORBIT maturity criteria are unchanged — all 41 aspects and level definitions remain the May 3, 2026 PRA submission verbatim. It is a clean break from prior data: IndexedDB clears existing assessment data on first load because capability area ids changed. See `docs/decisions/CAPABILITY_MODEL_UPDATE_PLAN.md` for the full scope record and decision log.

### Restructured

- **Capability model totals**: 16 domains / 66 areas → **14 domains / 72 areas** (Strategic 3/10, Core 7/33, Support 4/29)
- **Enterprise Architecture domain**: moved Support → **Strategic**; now contains the single combined **Enterprise Governance** capability area hosting all 15 organizational aspects in three sections (Organizational Outcomes, Organizational Roles, Organizational Enterprise Architecture)
- **Organizational assessments consolidated**: the three separate organizational areas (`organizational-outcomes`, `organizational-roles`, `organizational-enterprise-architecture`) merged into the one `enterprise-governance` area; the Enterprise Governance domain was dissolved
- **Combined organizational scoring**: overall score = average of the three section averages (sections without assessed aspects excluded), mirroring how B-I-T assessments average dimension scores; sections weigh equally regardless of aspect counts (pending working-group affirmation in staging)
- **Category tier removed**: the metamodel is strictly Domain → Area; Data Management and Technology Management areas are flat lists

### Added

- **"Information Management" pattern**: every business domain has an `<X> Information Management` capability area (11 total; 9 new — Contract and Financial already existed)
- **Information Management guidance banner**: warning notice on Information Management area assessment pages explaining the assess-once-per-domain guidance (per BA working group meeting decision; conditional/aggregate workflow explicitly deferred)
- New capability areas: Program Administration, Strategy Oversight and Accountability, Contractor Support Management, Provider Eligibility, and the 9 new Information Management areas — all with marked placeholder descriptions pending the updated Capability Reference Model document from NextGen
- History view now renders the combined organizational assessment (sections and aspects); previously organizational snapshots displayed empty B-I-T pages
- Import validation: assessments and history entries referencing capability areas not in the current model are skipped with reason "Capability area not in current model" (prevents unreachable orphan records from v3 exports)
- CSV maturity profiles for the organizational assessment include `Section:` label rows grouping each section's aspects; the parser skips label rows on import
- Database schema v4 migration (clean break, clears all data)
- Archived sources under `docs/source-documents/2026-07-30/` (deck, meeting transcript, authoritative slide extraction); `scripts/extract-pptx.py` and `scripts/generate-capabilities-v4.py`

### Changed

- Renamed domains: Enterprise Data Management → **Data Management**; Enterprise Technology → **Technology Management** (ids `data-management`/`technical` retained; aggregate dimension behavior unchanged)
- Renamed areas: Provider Screening → **Provider Eligibility** (placeholder description; slide 5 authoritative), Maintain Strategic Plan → **Strategic Plan Maintenance**, Develop Agency Roadmap → **Strategic Roadmap Management**, Member Eligibility/Enrollment Management → **Member Eligibility**/**Member Enrollment**, Accounts Receivable/Payable → **Accounts Receivable/Payable Management**, Data Quality → **Data Quality Management**, Data Storage and Warehousing → **Data Storage, Operations, and Warehousing**
- Waiver Management moved from Care and Service Coordination to Plan and Policy Management
- Completion percentages now use per-area denominators: 15 aspects for the combined organizational area, standard aspects minus the aggregated dimension for enterprise-domain areas (16 for Data Management areas, 15 for Technology Management areas), 26 otherwise — fixes the prior fixed-26 divisor
- Assessment sidebar groups the organizational assessment's aspects under section headers; fixed a list-structure accessibility violation in the organizational navigation
- PDF export renders the organizational assessment per section with section subheaders
- In-app copy (Landing, Guide) updated to 72 areas and the combined organizational assessment

### Removed

- Business Relationship Management domain and its 2 areas
- Enterprise Governance domain (dissolved into the combined area)
- Capability areas: State Plan Administration, Business Intelligence & Data Science
- `CategorizedCapabilityDomain`/`CapabilityCategory` types and all category handling

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-03

This is a major release that ingests the final MITA workgroup PRA submission (May 3, 2026) as the official source of truth for the MITA 4.0 maturity criteria. It is a clean break from prior data — IndexedDB will clear existing assessment data on first load to avoid orphaned ratings.

This release supersedes an unreleased April 26 v3.0.0 working draft. Users upgrading from v2.1.0 see the cumulative changes summarized below; the underlying model is the May 3 PRA submission verbatim.

### Restructured (vs v2.1.0)

- **Business Architecture**: Reworked from 7 enterprise-flavored aspects to 5 process-focused aspects (`Business Process Performance`, `Business Process Documentation`, `Business Process Governance`, `Business Process Automation`, `Business Process Reporting`)
- **Information**: Reworked from 11 data-management aspects to 10 information-focused aspects with new ordering (`Information Classification` first); `Metadata Management`, `Information Reporting`, and `Information Metadata` removed per workgroup direction
- **Technology**: Consolidated from 22 aspects across 7 sub-dimensions to 11 aspects across 2 sub-dimensions (`Technical Infrastructure Management` with 6 aspects; `Application Management` with 5 aspects)
- **Outcomes & Roles**: Extracted to organizational-level assessments under a new `Enterprise Governance` Support-layer domain. Outcomes has 6 aspects; Roles has 5 (was 6 — `Technology Resources` removed in May 3 source)
- **Enterprise Architecture**: New organizational-level assessment under a new `Enterprise Architecture` Support-layer domain with 4 aspects (`Business Capability`, `Enterprise Architecture`, `Policy Management`, `Strategic Planning`) — extracted from the old Business Architecture
- **Technical capability domain**: Restructured from 7 categories / 22 areas to 2 categories / 11 areas, mirroring the Technology dimension
- **Capability totals**: 75 areas / 14 domains → 66 areas / 16 domains
- **Aspect totals**: 52 → 41 (26 standard + 15 organizational)

### Added

- New source document `MITA Maturity Criteria_PRA Submission 2026-05-03.docx` archived under `docs/source-documents/2026-05-03/`
- `scripts/extract-new-docx.py` to extract aspects from the May 3 PRA submission docx
- `scripts/generate-orbit-model-v3.py` to generate `orbit-model.json` from the extracted aspects
- Database schema v3 migration that clears all existing data (model is incompatible with prior versions)
- New `enterprise-architecture-domain` capability domain (Support layer) with `organizational-enterprise-architecture` area
- New `enterprise-governance` capability domain (Support layer) with `organizational-outcomes` and `organizational-roles` areas
- `OrganizationalAssessmentId` and `RatingDimensionId` types
- Helper functions in `orbit.ts` for organizational assessments and enterprise-domain aggregates

### Changed

- **Maturity model now reflects May 3, 2026 PRA submission verbatim** — single official source replaces the prior April 26 working drafts
- Renamed dimension: `Information & Data` → `Information` (id `informationData` → `information`)
- Renamed domains: `Data Management` → `Enterprise Data Management`; `Technical` → `Enterprise Technology`
- Enterprise Data Management is now assessed B-T with Information shown as an aggregate of all other finalized assessments
- Enterprise Technology is now assessed B-I with Technology shown as an aggregate of all other finalized assessments
- `OrbitDimensionId` reduced to `'businessArchitecture' | 'information' | 'technology'` (Outcomes/Roles/EA moved to organizational assessments)
- Sub-dimension display name `Technology Infrastructure Management` → `Technical Infrastructure Management` (id `technologyInfrastructureManagement` retained for stability)
- Adopted source-verbatim Technology aspect names with one typo fix:
  - `Identify, Access, and Consent` → `Identity, Access and Consent` (typo corrected)
  - `Development, Testing, Release, and Security Compliance` → `Development, Testing, Release and Security Compliance`
  - `Business Rules and Workflow` → `Business Rules and Workflows`
  - `User Interface and Session Management` → `User Interfaces and Session Management`
- `capabilities.json` Technical capability area names and IDs aligned with the new Technology aspect names so platform-capability and platform-maturity views stay 1-to-1
- ORBIT model schema simplified per source: per-level question checklists removed in favor of one aspect-level question + per-level criteria + per-level "Suggested Documentation" (stored as `evidence`)
- Outcomes/Roles aspect descriptions and per-level descriptions populated from the docx (previously sparse)
- Dashboard groups domains by layer (Strategic, Core, Support) with section headers
- CSV export emits B-I-T rows for standard areas; organizational assessments use an `Aspect` header
- App version 2.1.0 → 3.0.0

### Removed

- Roles aspect `Technology Resources` (per May 3 source)
- Per-level question checklists in Information and Technology aspects (now a single aspect-level question per source)
- Outcomes/Roles dimensions from per-capability assessments (moved to organizational level)

### Documentation

- Restructured `docs/` into `source-documents/` (archived by date), `reference/` (reference snapshots), and `decisions/` (historic specs)
- Folded former `docs/updated-documents/` (April 26 drop) under `docs/source-documents/2026-04-26/`
- Folded former `docs/double-check-docs/` under `docs/source-documents/pre-pilot-originals/`
- Updated `README.md` and `PROJECT_FOUNDATION_v2.md` to describe the May 3 model

- New organizational assessment functions in `orbit.ts`: `getOrganizationalAssessment`, `getOrganizationalAspects`, `getOrganizationalAspectCount`, `getOrganizationalAspect`
- New helper functions in `constants/index.ts`: `isOrganizationalAssessmentArea`, `getOrganizationalAssessmentType`
- Layer grouping in dashboard with color-coded headers (Strategic: blue, Core: green, Support: purple)
- Organizational assessment navigation mode in AssessmentSidebar for direct aspect selection
- Import service now filters ratings based on assessment type:
  - Standard assessments: only import B-I-T ratings, skip orphaned O&R ratings from old exports
  - Organizational assessments: only import outcomes/roles ratings, skip B-I-T ratings
- New tests for B-I-T only filtering and organizational assessment import handling
- New tests for organizational assessment CSV format with "Aspect" header

---

## [2.0.5] - 2026-01-28

### Changed

- Renamed ORBIT dimension "Information & Data" to "Information" (ID: `informationData` → `information`)
- Renamed domain "Data Management" to "Enterprise Data Management"
- Renamed domain "Technical" to "Enterprise Technology"
- Enterprise Data Management domain now assesses B-T only; Information dimension shows aggregate score from all other finalized assessments
- Enterprise Technology domain now assesses B-I only; Technology dimension shows aggregate score from all other finalized assessments
- Aggregate dimension scores are included in overall capability score calculations for enterprise domains
- Updated CSV export template to use "Information" instead of "Information & Data"
- Updated PDF export to reflect new dimension and domain names
- History snapshots for enterprise domains now store aggregate score at snapshot time for point-in-time accuracy
- CSV export now includes "(Aggregate from X assessments)" note for aggregate dimensions
- JSON/ZIP export now includes `enterpriseAggregates` metadata with contributing assessment IDs
- Improved assessment sidebar layout with column headers (Dimension, Prog, Score) for better clarity
- Technology dimension now displays as a parent row with rolled-up progress and score, with sub-dimensions indented underneath
- Progress indicators now use color-coded chips: plain text for not started, amber for in progress, green with checkmark for complete
- Streamlined dimension header in assessment view by removing redundant progress display (already shown in sidebar)
- Dimension header now uses inline layout for more compact appearance

### Added

- New `AggregateDimensionView` component for displaying aggregate scores in enterprise domains
- Aggregate dimension indicator in assessment sidebar with score preview
- Score breakdown view showing contributing assessments for aggregate dimensions
- New helper functions in `orbit.ts`: `getAggregatedDimensionForDomain`, `isAggregatedDimension`, `hasAggregatedDimension`, `isEnterpriseDomain`
- New `getAggregateDimensionScore` function in `useScores` hook for calculating aggregate scores
- Enterprise domain configuration constants: `ENTERPRISE_DOMAIN_IDS`, `DOMAIN_AGGREGATE_DIMENSIONS`
- `AggregateSnapshotData` type for storing aggregate metadata in history snapshots
- `ExportAggregateData` and `ExportEnterpriseAssessment` types for export metadata
- History view now properly displays stored aggregate scores for enterprise domain snapshots
- Import backwards compatibility: files exported with old `informationData` dimension ID are automatically mapped to `information` during import

### Removed

- Removed "opt" labels from optional dimensions in sidebar (Outcomes, Roles) to reduce visual clutter

## [2.0.4] - 2026-01-28

### Changed

- Consolidated duplicate history snapshot logic into shared `src/services/history.ts` service
- Unified scoring calculations to use `calculateAverageScore` from `scoring.ts` across all files
- Extracted tag management operations into shared `src/services/tags.ts` service
- Export service now uses build-time injected `__APP_VERSION__` instead of hardcoded version

### Added

- New `src/services/history.ts` with `createHistorySnapshot`, `calculateDimensionScores`, and `toHistoricalRatings` utilities
- New `src/services/tags.ts` with `incrementTagUsage`, `createTag`, `deleteTag`, `renameTag`, and `cleanupUnusedTags` utilities
- Comprehensive test coverage for new history service (16 tests)
- Comprehensive test coverage for new tags service (18 tests)

## [2.0.3] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Fixed attachment upload bug where files would attach to the first aspect in a dimension instead of the selected aspect. The issue was caused by duplicate HTML element IDs across multiple AttachmentUpload components; now uses React's useId() hook to generate unique IDs.
- Fixed duplicate attachment filename bug in export/import: when multiple attachments had the same filename, only one would be preserved after export/import cycle. Export now uses unique filenames with embedded attachment IDs, and import matches by ID with fallback to filename for backward compatibility.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-01-25

### Added

- 404 Not Found page for invalid routes within the application
- GitHub Pages SPA redirect support to fix browser refresh on deep links
