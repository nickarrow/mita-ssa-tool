/**
 * ExcelJS assembly for the MITA 4.0 self-assessment workbook.
 *
 * This layer places rows built by `rows.ts` and `readme.ts` onto sheets and applies
 * the 508 structure from Section 5.3 of the pilot clearance plan. It deliberately
 * builds no content of its own, so a content defect fails a `rows.test.ts` assertion
 * and a structure defect fails a `workbook.test.ts` assertion.
 *
 * ExcelJS is a pinned devDependency and must never reach the browser bundle
 * (Decision 12). The vendor chunk is already 450 kB gzipped and over its own warning
 * threshold (OBS-20), and this workbook is generated at build time, so it costs the
 * shipped app nothing.
 *
 * ## What 5.3 requires, and where each requirement is implemented here
 *
 * | Requirement                              | Where                          |
 * | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
 * | No merged cells                          | nothing in this file merges    |
 * | One header row per table                 | `HEADER_ROW`, `addTableSheet`  |
 * | No blank rows or columns inside tables   | `addTableSheet`, no spacers    |
 * | Not conveyed by colour alone             | `renderHeader` suffix          |
 * | Descriptive tab names                    | `SHEET_NAMES`                  |
 * | No images or floating objects            | nothing adds one               |
 * | Document properties set                  | `applyDocumentProperties`      |
 * | Print header/footer duplicated in-sheet  | `applyNoticeRow` + footer      |
 * | Locked cells reachable by AT             | `selectLockedCells: true`      |
 * | ID columns visible, outside the range    | `identifier` columns, no hide  |
 * | Defined table ranges                     | `NAMED_RANGES`                 |

/**
 * Write the notice into `A1` and the print header/footer.
 *
 * Option D of the disclaimer treatment, settled with the user on September 14. Three
 * placements, each covering a gap the others leave:
 *
 * - **`A1`, short line.** Ctrl+Home lands here, so a keyboard or screen reader user
 *   meets the notice before any data. Excel reopens a file on its last active sheet,
 *   so a per-sheet notice is the only way a reviewer who lands on `04_Assessment_Input`
 *   sees one at all.
 * - **Print footer, short line.** Covers printed and PDF'd copies, where cell A1 of a
 *   1,625-row sheet appears only on the first page.
 * - **README and the `description` property, full text including the PRA statement.**
 *   The substantive statement, in the two places with room for it.
 *
 * ## Why the footer carries the short line and not the full PRA statement
 *
 * It was specified as the full line, and **the full line does not fit**. Excel's limit
 * for a footer is 255 characters; `DRAFT_NOTICE_LINE` alone is 420, and with the `&L&8`
 * and page-number codes the string is 441. Over-length footer text is rejected or
 * truncated by Excel, which would have produced a *silently mangled* PRA statement —
 * worse than an abbreviated one.
 *
 * Shortening the wording was not available either: Decision 15 requires the CMS-supplied
 * text verbatim, and the PRA sentence by itself exceeds 255. So the full statement
 * cannot go in an Excel footer at all, by anyone, and the README plus the document
 * `description` property carry it instead. `assertFooterFits` makes the constraint
 * enforced rather than remembered.
 *
 * This mirrors what the PDF already does — full statement on the cover, short line in
 * the per-page footer — so the two artifacts are consistent.
 *
 * Note 5.3 also requires that print-header content appear as sheet content, because
 * screen readers do not read print headers. The footer's short line is exactly what
 * `A1` carries, so that rule is satisfied per sheet; the full text's in-sheet home is
 * the README.
