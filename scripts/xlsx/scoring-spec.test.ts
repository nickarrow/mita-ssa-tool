/**
 * The workbook's scoring model, tested against the app's canonical scorer.
 *
 * This is what makes `scoring-spec.ts` worth having. The formulas are generated from the same
 * definitions these tests exercise, so proving the model agrees with `calculateDimensionScore`
 * proves the *rule* the formulas encode is the tool's rule.
 *
 * **What it does not prove.** It says nothing about whether the Excel expression implements the
 * model — ExcelJS cannot evaluate a formula, so that gap closes only by opening the file. It
 * also cannot catch Excel/JS rounding divergence, because the model deliberately shares the
 * app's `Math.round(x * 10) / 10`; `halfway.test.ts` enumerates that separately.
 *
 * Fixtures are driven off the real model rather than invented, so a change to aspect counts
 * shows up here rather than silently altering what is being compared.
