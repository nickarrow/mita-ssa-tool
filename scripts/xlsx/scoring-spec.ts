/**
 * The scoring rules, expressed twice from one place: as JS functions and as Excel formulas.
 *
 * This is mitigation step 1 from Section 5.4 of the pilot clearance plan, and the one that
 * carries the weight. ExcelJS cannot evaluate a formula, so no test can assert that a cell
 * computes 3.4. What *can* be done is model each rule in JS, test that model against the
 * app's canonical scorer over shared fixtures, and generate the formula string from the same
 * definition — so the formula and the tested model cannot drift apart independently.
 *
 * It is not proof. A JS model that matches `calculateDimensionScore` proves the *rule* is
 * right; it says nothing about whether the Excel expression implements that rule. Only opening
 * the file does that, which is why Wave 7 ends with an arithmetic check in Excel.
 *
 * ## The four rounding points, which are not the same
 *
 * Getting these wrong is how the workbook silently disagrees with the tool, and they are
 * genuinely inconsistent in the app — deliberately, following a display-rounds /
 * scoring-does-not convention:
 *
 * | Roll-up               | Inputs                          | Rounds |
 * | --------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------ |
 * | Non-Technology dim    | aspect levels                   | once   |
 * | Technology dim        | two sub-dimension means, **unrounded** | once at the end |
 * | Standard area         | dimension scores, **already rounded**  | again  |
 * | Organizational area   | section means, **unrounded**    | once at the end |
 *
 * So a standard area averages rounded inputs and the organizational area averages unrounded
 * ones. That is why `06_Maturity_Profile` carries both a rounded score column and an unrounded
 * column: the two roll-ups above it consume different ones.
 *
 * ## Why Excel needs helper cells at all
 *
 * `AVERAGE` ignores text and blanks inside a **cell reference**, but returns `#VALUE!` for text
 * passed as a **direct argument**. The Technology rule is "mean of the two sub-dimension means,
 * dropping a sub-dimension with nothing assessed" — and the drop cannot be written inline,
 * because `AVERAGE(IFERROR(x,""), IFERROR(y,""))` errors the moment one side is empty. Writing
 * the two means into their own columns and then averaging *those cells* gets the drop for free.
 * The same applies to the organizational section means.
