# MITA 4.0 State Self-Assessment Tool

A Progressive Web App (PWA) enabling State Medicaid Agencies (SMAs) to self-assess their Medicaid Enterprise maturity using the **MITA 4.0 Maturity Model**.

## Overview

The MITA 4.0 State Self-Assessment Tool helps State Medicaid Agencies evaluate their Medicaid Enterprise Systems (MES) maturity across **72 capability areas** using the standardized **ORBIT Maturity Model**. The tool is:

- **Privacy-First**: All data stays in your browser. No data is transmitted or stored remotely.
- **Offline-capable**: A service worker caches the app on first visit, so it loads and runs with no
  network afterwards — including the offline Excel workbook, which is precached too. Updates are
  offered by prompt rather than applied silently, so a pilot user is never moved to a new build
  mid-assessment.
- **Accessible**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant for government use.

### What is ORBIT?

ORBIT is the MITA 4.0 maturity assessment framework. Each business capability area is assessed against three required dimensions:

| Dimension                 | Aspects                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **B**usiness Architecture | 5                            |
| **I**nformation           | 10                           |
| **T**echnology            | 11 (across 2 sub-dimensions) |

The combined **Enterprise Governance** capability area (Enterprise Architecture domain, Strategic layer) evaluates enterprise-level maturity once per organization across three sections:

| Organizational Section                 | Aspects |
| -------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Organizational Outcomes                | 6       |
| Organizational Roles                   | 5       |
| Organizational Enterprise Architecture | 4       |

> Outcomes and Roles ("O" and "R" in the original ORBIT acronym) describe organizational maturity rather than per-capability maturity, so they are assessed once in the combined Enterprise Governance assessment rather than per capability area.

Each aspect is rated on a 5-level maturity scale:

- **Level 1**: Initial
- **Level 2**: Developing
- **Level 3**: Defined
- **Level 4**: Managed
- **Level 5**: Optimized
- **N/A**: Not Applicable

## Offline Excel Workbook

States that cannot use a browser-based tool can complete the same assessment in an Excel
workbook generated from the same `capabilities.json` and `orbit-model.json` the app uses, so both
artifacts are built from one model. Whether they always _compute_ identically is a narrower claim —
the workbook's scoring is a second implementation in Excel formulas, and no test here can evaluate a
formula. See "Verifying it" below.

The workbook has ten sheets: a README, three reference sheets, two input sheets covering all
14 capability domains, 72 capability areas and 41 maturity aspects, and four calculated sheets
that compute dimension, capability area, domain and enterprise-wide scores with Excel formulas
mirroring the app's own scoring rules. It is built for Section 508 conformance — no merged
cells, one header row per table, no blank rows, no images, and editable columns labelled in
text rather than signalled by fill colour alone.

It is generated at build time by a Node script under `scripts/`, so it adds nothing to the
browser bundle, and it is gitignored as a build output. `npm run build` and `npm run dev` both
generate it automatically, so a fresh clone needs no extra step — just `npm install` and either
command.

Users reach it from three places in the app: the Import & Export page, the home page, and the
Guide. All three link to the same static file under the deployment base path.

> Use `npm run dev`, not a bare `vite`. Generation is wired to the `predev` script, so invoking
> Vite directly starts a server with no workbook and the three download links 404. The same is
> true if the file is deleted while a dev server is already running — regenerate with
> `npm run generate:workbook`.

### Verifying it

`npm test` covers the generator's output as data and as raw OOXML, but no test can evaluate an
Excel formula. `npm run verify:workbook-excel` closes that gap by driving Microsoft Excel over
AppleScript: it copies the workbook, enters maturity levels and notes, reads the calculated
cells back, and compares them against the app's scoring rules. It needs macOS and a licensed
Excel, so it is a manual gate before shipping a workbook change rather than part of CI.

`npm run verify:workbook-artifact` checks a third thing: the copy that actually ships. The test
suite builds a workbook in memory and never reads a file, and the Excel gate reads the `public/`
copy, so neither would notice a build that failed to put the workbook into `dist/` — which is
what the in-app download links serve. Both CI and the deploy workflow run it after the build.

`node scripts/xlsx/prove-assertions.ts` is a mutation harness that breaks the generator in
turn and confirms the relevant test fails, so the accessibility and scoring assertions are
known to be capable of failing. It rewrites source files in place and restores them, so run it
on a clean tree.

## Data Architecture

The application uses two primary JSON files that can be edited to update capabilities or ORBIT criteria:

### Capability Reference Model (`capabilities.json`)

Defines **what** can be assessed:

- 14 capability domains across 3 layers (Strategic, Core, Support)
- 72 capability areas with descriptions and topics (strictly Domain → Area, no category tier)
- 11 "Information Management" areas flagged for in-app assessment guidance
- Sourced from the BA working group capability model (July 2026, slides 4–6)
- No maturity questions—just metadata

### ORBIT Model (`orbit-model.json`)

Defines **how** assessments are conducted:

- 3 standard dimensions (B, I, T) with 26 total aspects applied to every capability area
- 3 organizational assessments (Outcomes, Roles, Enterprise Architecture) with 15 total aspects assessed once per organization
- Standardized maturity criteria with descriptions and "Suggested Documentation" per maturity level
- Sourced verbatim from the May 3, 2026 PRA submission

### Local Storage (IndexedDB)

All user data is stored locally:

- Capability assessments (one per area)
- ORBIT ratings (one per aspect per assessment)
- File attachments (stored as Blobs)
- Assessment history (snapshots)
- Tags for organization

## Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 90+
- Safari 15+
- Edge 90+

IndexedDB is required — it is where assessments are stored, so the tool cannot run without it.
Service Worker support is what makes the app load without a network; where it is unavailable or
blocked by policy, everything still works while online and saving is unaffected.
